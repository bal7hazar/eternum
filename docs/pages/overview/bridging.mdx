# Bridge Closure

<Callout type="danger">
  Important information – Game Bridge **permanently** closes **48 hours** after victory has been claimed. <br />

</Callout>

## Bridging in Eternum

Eternum is a fully onchain game with immutable smart contracts, meaning the game rules cannot be altered after
deployment. Bridging tokens in and out of the game is a core mechanic, but you must carefully manage this process. The
game bridge closes **forever** 48 hours after the game ends (victory claimed). Any tokens left in the game at that time
are **permanently locked** in the contract (effectively **burned**).

Bridging out of the game is done by sending resources to a bank. This process takes **time and requires donkeys** as
part of the gameplay mechanics. Since the contracts are immutable, "code is law." Players must plan accordingly, as the
developers cannot modify the system after deployment.

## Bridging in

This is the only way to bridge in Lords to the game. This converts ERC20 Lords into in-game Lords. Only in-game Lords
can be used to build and trade with.

### Initial Bridge

You need to first initialize the transfer.

### Final Bridge (Within Game Client)

Once you finish the first step, the Lords/resources will appear in your inventory to be used in the game.

## Bridging out

You can bridge out resources from the game, which will be converted to the ERC20 contracts.

### Step 1: Start the bridge

### Game End

When the game ends, players will have **48 hours** to withdraw all in-game assets including:

> - All **$LORDS** tokens
> - Resources in storage
> - Market orders
> - Liquidity pool positions
> - Any other in-game assets

To preserve your assets, you **must**:

> 1. Remove liquidity from AMM pools before the game ends.
> 2. Cancel open orders on the Order Book.
> 3. Bridge out **$LORDS** and **Resources** through the Central Bank before the game ends.

### ⚠️ Key Reminders ⚠️

- The 48 hour window after the game ends is your **final** opportunity to secure your in-game assets.
- Developers **cannot** intervene or make exceptions after the bridge closes.
- Plan ahead to ensure a smooth and timely withdrawal of your assets.
